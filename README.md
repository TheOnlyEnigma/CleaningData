## ASSIGNMENT SUMMARY

The R script, named run_analysis.R, produces the following results when the code is ran:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.


2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.


3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set


4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.


5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average 
of each variable for each activity and each subject.
